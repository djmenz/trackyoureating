# trackyoureating
Old Project for simple macro tracking (enter meals eaten each day, get stats on the macros)

### Summary

Project used to start to learn python, code quality is very low, here for archive purposes. 

Uses the deprecated web.py framework, purely server rendered pages, no .js so each request regenerates the whole page. Uses mysql as persistent datastore.
